# Logiverse

The logiverse was a HIGHLY EXPERIMENTAL network of social media sites. 

## Sign up

To sign up, just [login](https://todepond.com/lab/login).

## Was that it? 

Well, no.

<br>

The logiverse was built for the [tadi web](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ft6xOAijwFo), which means that it was really really really radically simple.

Because of this, there were lots of different logiverse sites. Here are some of them: 

- [Loggo](https://svenlaa.com/playground/loggo) by [Sven Lammertink](https://svenlaa.com)
- [Login](https://todepond.com/lab/login) by [Lu Wilson](https://todepond.com)
- [Login Redux](https://login.rossilaz.xyz) by [Rosy](https://mastodon.gamedev.place/@Mittzy)
- [Logon](https://evolved.systems/logon) by [Rafał Hirsz](https://evolved.systems)
- [Lodge](https://lodge.maemoon.me) by [Mae Moon](http://maemoon.me)
- [LogiVert](https://logivert.pages.dev) by [Elouan Grimm](https://elouan.xyz/)

There were also various different clients. All of the sites above had their own client, and there was also:

- [Logarithm](https://tristie.org/logarithm/) by [Tristie](https://tristie.org)
- [Loft](https://github.com/cute-catgirl/Loft) by [Mae Moon](http://maemoon.me)
- [Signup](https://gaimeri.github.io/signup/) by [gaimeri](https://bsky.app/profile/gaimeri.bsky.social)
- [Logiverse café](https://uprun.github.io/logiverse-cafe/logiverse-caf%C3%A9.html) by [Oleksandr Kryvonos](https://uprun.github.io/)

Some people had created their own [command-line client](https://xoxo.zone/@annika/113136710954037798) too.

Join us! We were exploring and experimenting with how far we could push this thing :)
